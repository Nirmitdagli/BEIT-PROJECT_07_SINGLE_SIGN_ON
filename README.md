## BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

<p align=justify>
Our single sign-on implementation mechanism is by using LDAP to serve as a personnel database, who personnel information between various systems. LDAP is short for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. LDAP server is used to store and retrieve information, which is similar to ordinary relational database. The main diﬀerences between LDAP servers and the general relational database are as follows: LDAP using tree model rather than rational model to organize information; Mainly provides data query services, the query speed faster than the ordinary relational database; Excellent ability to copy the information makes it highly robust. LDAP tree information organization model is similar to the actual hierarchical relationships between the various departments of an organization. So, using LDAP to store personnel information made management easier.
Single sign-on (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials (e.g., name and password) to access multiple applications.The service authenticates the end user for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.
On the back end, SSO is helpful for logging user activities as well as monitoring user accounts. Single sign-on reduces human error, a major component of systems failure and is therefore highly desirable but diﬃcult to implement. SSO avoids the monotonous task of conﬁrming identity over and over again through passwords or other authentication systems
